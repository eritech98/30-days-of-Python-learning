# 30-days-of-Python-learning
Day 2 of the "30 Days of Python" project, authored by Erick Olando, focuses on variable declarations and basic operations. In this exercise, you create a `day_2` folder within the `30DaysOfPython` directory and add a file named `variables.py`. Inside this file, you begin with a comment: "Day 2: 30 Days of python programming". You then declare and assign values to various variables such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `full_name`, `country`, `city`, `age`, `year`, `is_married`, `is_true`, and `is_light_on`, including declaring multiple variables in a single line. The exercises involve checking data types with the `type()` function, measuring string lengths using the `len()` function, and comparing the lengths of `first_name` and `last_name`. Additionally, you perform basic arithmetic operations and calculate the area and circumference of a circle with a given radius, extending this to accept user input for the radius. Lastly, you use the `input()` function to gather personal information and run `help('keywords')` to check Python reserved words.
